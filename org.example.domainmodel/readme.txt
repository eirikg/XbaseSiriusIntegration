The test is based on the "Five simple steps to your JVM language":

https://eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/104_jvmdomainmodel.html

The org.example.domainmodel bundle contains the sample language and the code generator

The domainmodel.ecore (generated by Xtext) and the EMF genrated model code is also in this bundle

The Xtext and EMF related bundles are generated and has the following name convention: 

org.example.domainmodel.* bundles are generated by Xtext(*.ide, *.ui, *.tests & *.ui.tests) and EMF (*.edit, *editor)

The two Sirius related bundles are; - org.example.test.domainmodel.diagram and - org.example.test.domainmodel.design

After cloning, import the diagram bundle in the target IDE and the rest of the buindles in the source IDE

You may check in the OSGi Console that all the bundles are started (STARTING or ACTIVE state) after launching the target IDE.
If not, you can start them manually from the OSGi console.

Open the the Entity diagram in the diagram bundle. Make the editor dirty by moving one the two displayed entities (Person and Address)
and save the diagram. This should generate the unsopported operation exception.
