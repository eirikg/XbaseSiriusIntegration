The Xtext sample project is based on the "Five simple steps to your JVM language":

https://eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/104_jvmdomainmodel.html

The org.example.domainmodel bundle contains the sample JVM language and the code generator

The domainmodel.ecore (generated by Xtext) and the EMF generated model code is also in this bundle

The generated Xtext and EMF related bundles have the following symbolic names: 

org.example.domainmodel.*  - Xtext(*.ide, *.ui, *.tests & *.ui.tests) and EMF (*.edit, *.editor)

The two Sirius related bundles are; - org.example.test.domainmodel.diagram and - org.example.test.domainmodel.design

After cloning or forking, import the diagram bundle in the target IDE and the rest of the bundles in the source IDE

You may check in the OSGi Console that all the bundles are started (STARTING or ACTIVE state) after launching the target IDE.
If not, you can start them manually from the OSGi console.


Verify the DeferredLayout NPE

1) Open both the diagram and the text version of My.dmodel at the same time
	a) Open the the Entity diagram in the diagram bundle.
	b) Open and add a new entity in My.dmodel in the text editor. e.g. entity Person1 {}  
	In general you must make a change in My.dmodel that forces Sirius to recalculate the layout after a Save
3) Save My.dmodel to generate the NPE

Resolved: Verify Save Exception

Open the the Entity diagram in the diagram bundle. 
Make the editor dirty by moving an entity (Person or Address) and save the diagram. 
This should generate the unsupported operation exception.
